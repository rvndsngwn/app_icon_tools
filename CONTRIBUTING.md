## How to contribute to App Icon Tools

### **Styleguide and Code generation**

All Dart code is linted with [Pedantic](https://pub.dev/packages/pedantic). All localization files are generated with [Flutter Intl](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/wiki/Localization#prerequisites).

### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/issues).

* **Ensure that the solution to your problem does not already exist** by searching at the [Troubleshooting Section](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/wiki/Troubleshooting) of this project's Wiki.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### **Did you localized/transated this project?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the translation.

* Please use [Localization Pull Request Template](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md) by adding:

``&template=pull_request_template.md``

to the end of your PR URL in browser's adress bar, for example:

``https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/compare/master...your_username:your_branch_name?expand=1&template=pull_request_template.md``

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of app will generally not be accepted for several reasons.

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [Discussions Section](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/discussions) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

### **Do you have questions about this project?**

* Take a look at project's [Wiki](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/wiki) or ask any question about this project at [Discussions](https://github.com/tsinis/app_icon_tools/discussions).
